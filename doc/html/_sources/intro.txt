Introduction
===================

Where's from
-------------------
This project was started from the discussion in training retrospective. We've 
found that it's confused to look back and forth between the comment
in github and Jira to read the comment or commit for the issue-id

What we think
-----------------
There must have a better way to link these information together. Our plan is to 

1. Get information from github feed about commits and comments (which contained
   the bug-id information)
2. Store the information in Jira Database.
3. Link the bug-id to Jira so it will be displayed in the issue page
   (comment/commit tabs) in Jira
   
How to do that
------------------
Write **Jira Plugin** to do the job (Java Language)
